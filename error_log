[12-Jan-2016 14:33:52 Asia/Jakarta] There doesn't seem to be a <em>bb-config.php</em> file or bb-config.php file does not contain required configuration parameters. I need this before we can get started. Need more help? <a target='_blank' href='http://docs.boxbilling.com/en/latest/reference/installation.html'>We got it</a>. You can create a <em>bb-config.php</em> file through a web interface, but this doesn't work for all server setups. The safest way is to manually create the file.</p><p><a href='http://inamawangi.com/numpang/install/index.php' class='button'>Continue with BoxBilling installation</a>
